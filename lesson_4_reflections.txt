local?
  - keep a backup of the files
  - other people may want to work on the files/project
  - testng a new feature on the local rep

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	- because you may not want the remote repository changes in your local repository

	be over written
