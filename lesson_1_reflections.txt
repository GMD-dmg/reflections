How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Made it a lot easier.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Easy to see the files progression and easier to revert if you make a mistake or change your mind

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manual change
    Pro - when you are sure of the changes you can save rather than some arbitary time
    Cpn - you can forget to save changes, the auto save can protect against that.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    The file could be related i.e. a set of file that need to be in sync.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    You can find the history of the file, its linage

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because it's easier to go back. Revert to a working version
